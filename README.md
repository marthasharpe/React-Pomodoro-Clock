# React Pomodoro Clock

### A countdown timer that alternates between work and break periods.

This was a project for the Front End Libraries Certification through freeCodeCamp.  
I used several new React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useRef.  
Using setInterval for the countdown was particularly challenging.
